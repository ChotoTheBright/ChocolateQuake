# WinQuake-VS2019
Modification of the Visual Studio 2015 Build of Quake orig. done by Philip Buuck

Rebuilt using Visual Studio 2019. Visual Studio from 2015 onward will attempt to build in x64 mode by default, but set up to build must be done in x86 mode (or Win32 for previous versions of Visual Studio). At the top of the Visual Studio window, if you see x64 in a drop down box, change it to x86 or Win32, whichever your version uses. Then build, and everything will compile.

This repo does not contain any .pak files, those must be obtained independently.
